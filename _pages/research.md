# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT)</span>
My thesis aims to solve practical problems in DOT breast imaging and to improve breast cancer diagnosis. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Tackling mismatch errors</span>
Proposed algorithms to mitigate probe-tissue contact problems and image artifacts, which can easily happen during clinical studies due to breast curvature and patient movement. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Difference imaging from single measurements</span>
Designed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to output data for difference imaging from target measurements only. This approach significantly simplifies data acquisition and post-processing, and it mitigates mismatch problems in DOT difference imaging using various systems for different applications. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Fusion network for breast lesion classification</span>
Trained a fusion network to combine DOT and co-registered ultrasound for real-time classification of breast lesions that can assist in clinical decisions.

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Human coloreactal cancer classification using deep learning and OCT</span>
Designed a customized ResNet and applied it to OCT colorectal images acquired with our homemade catheter.

# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI)</span>
Trained an AdaBoost classifier using optical absorption and scattering features calculated from SFDI colorectal images.

# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Image-guided Photo-mediated Ultrasound Therapy</span>
Simultaneously applied laser and ultrasound treat neovascularization in rabbit eyes guided by OCT & photoacoustic microscopy (PAM).
Simulated bubble dynamics under simultaneous laser & ultrasound and validated the simulations with experiments on tubes filled with blood.
