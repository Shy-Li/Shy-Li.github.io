# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT)</span>
## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Tackling mismatch errors</span>
My thesis aims to solve practical problems in DOT breast imaging and to improve breast cancer diagnosis. I proposed algorithms to mitigate probe-tissue contact problems and image artifacts, which can easily happen during clinical studies due to breast curvature and patient movement.

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Difference imaging from single measurements</span>
Designed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to output data for difference imaging from target measurements only. This approach significantly simplifies data acquisition and post-processing, and it mitigates mismatch problems in DOT difference imaging using various systems for different applications. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Fusion network for breast lesion classification</span>
Trained a fusion network to combine DOT and co-registered ultrasound for real-time classification of breast lesions that can assist in clinical decisions.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can differentiate normal colonic mucosa from neoplasia, potentially offering a new mechanism of endoscopic tissue assessment and biopsy targeting, with a high optical resolution and an imaging depth of ~1 mm. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled application in ophthalmology, cardiology, and gastroenterology malignancy detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a miniaturized OCT catheter and a residual neural network (ResNet)-based deep learning model manufactured and trained to perform automatic image processing and real-time diagnosis of the OCT images. The OCT catheter has an outer diameter of 3.8 mm, a lateral resolution of ~7 μm, and an axial resolution of ~6 μm. A customized ResNet is utilized to classify OCT catheter colorectal images. An area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.975 is achieved to distinguish between normal and cancerous colorectal tissue images.

Trained an AdaBoost classifier using optical absorption and scattering features calculated from SFDI colorectal images.

Simultaneously applied laser and ultrasound treat neovascularization in rabbit eyes guided by OCT & photoacoustic microscopy (PAM).
Simulated bubble dynamics under simultaneous laser & ultrasound and validated the simulations with experiments on tubes filled with blood.
