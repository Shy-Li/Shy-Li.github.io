I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Boston University, working under the supervision of Professors Lei Tian and Irving Bigio. I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was mentored by Dr. Quing Zhu. As a researcher at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical imaging, my work spans a broad spectrum of applications, from diagnosis to understanding disease mechanisms, focusing on cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). I leverage AI to enhance the capabilities of both traditional and emerging imaging modalities by uncovering hidden patterns and integrating multimodal data. I aim to address practical challenges in clinical and preclinical studies, ultimately assisting in clinical decision-making and enhancing the quality of patients' lives.
