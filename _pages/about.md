I am an incoming  Assistant Professor in Chemical, Paper, and Biomedical Engineering at Miami Universityâ€“Oxford. I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis in 2023 and am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Boston University.  My research develops AI tools for biomedical imaging to improve diagnosis, deepen biological insight, and support clinical decision-making. My work spans a broad spectrum of applications, from diagnosis to understanding disease mechanisms, focusing on cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). I develop trustworthy AI tools to enhance the capabilities of both traditional and emerging imaging modalities by uncovering hidden patterns and integrating multimodal data. I aim to address practical challenges in clinical and preclinical studies, ultimately assisting in clinical decision-making and enhancing the quality of patients' lives.
