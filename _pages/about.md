I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis. I have been working with Dr.Quing Zhu on cancer diagnosis using optical imaging, including diffuse optical tomography, optical coherence tomography, and spatial frequency domain imaging. I focuse on tackling practical problems in clinical/preclinical studies using algorithms and machine learning.
