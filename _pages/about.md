I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Boston University, working under the supervision of Professors Lei Tian and Irving Bigio. I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was mentored by Dr. Quing Zhu. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University and a master's degree from the University of Michigan. My research focuses on developing deep learning approaches for biomedical imaging, with applications in cancer and neuroimaging. I aim to address practical challenges in clinical and preclinical studies, ultimately assisting in clinical decision-making and enhancing the quality of patients' lives.

Outside the lab, I spend a lot of time listening to concerts and traveling around. I enjoy playing the piano, calligraphy, painting, and photography.
