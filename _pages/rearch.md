# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Diffuse Optical Tomography</span>
My thesis aims to solve practical problems in DOT breast imaging and to improve breast cancer diagnosis. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Tackling mismatch errors</span>
I proposed algorithms to mitigate probe-tissue contact problems and image artifacts, which can easily happen during clinical studies due to breast curvature and patient movement. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Tackling mismatch errors</span>
 I trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to output data for difference imaging from target measurements only. This approach significantly simplifies data acquisition and post-processing, and it mitigates mismatch problems in DOT difference imaging using various systems for different applications. 

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Fusion network for breast lesion classification</span>
I am now working on a fusion network to combine DOT and co-registered ultrasound for real-time classification of breast lesions that can assist in clinical decisions.

## <span style="color:teal; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 25px;">Human coloreactal cancer classification using deep learning and OCT</span>
I designed a customized ResNet and applied it to OCT colorectal images acquired with our homemade catheter. 

# <span style="color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size: 20px;">Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging</span>
I trained an AdaBoost classifier using optical absorption and scattering features calculated from SFDI colorectal images
